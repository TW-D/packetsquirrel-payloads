## Prerequisite

Packet Squirrel Mark II

## Description

This payload uses *inotifywait* and *DYNAMICPROXY* to monitor the HTTP POST data streams generated by a client and extract sensitive information using *awk*.

## Configuration

In the **./modules/login_request.awk** file, you can improve the regular expression, contained in the **login_patterns** variable (L3), by adding new HTTP parameters. Additionally, you can add new *AWK* files to the **./modules/** directory; they will be automatically taken into account.

## Usage

The captured credentials will be available in the file **./loots/credentials/<TIMESTAMP>.log**.
